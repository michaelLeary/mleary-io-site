<p>The following note is one of a series on philosophy. The thoughts are prepared by a family elder.</p>
<div id="page-one" class="section level2">
<h2>Page One</h2>
<p>In the pure sense it’s (philosophy) concerned with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our nature: what we are.</li>
<li>Our understanding: how we know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Political theory and aesthetics are subsidiary offshoots.</p>
<p>For the Greeks, the paradigm was Mind + Body + Soul.</p>
<p>1600 watershed moment: coincided with the explosion of scientific discoveries in the West (Royal Societies formed in France and UK).</p>
<p>Theories of Descartes and Locke.</p>
<div id="soul" class="section level3">
<h3>Soul</h3>
<p>The Church took monopoly control of man’s Soul after 800 and Charlemagne.</p>
<p>Church and State began to operate as a double act. You look after my back : I’ll look after your’s. We’ll both be better off that way!</p>
<p>Soul became progressively out of fashion after 1918.</p>
<p>Atheists argued “ how could God have licenced the evil of WW1” - and then there was the Holocaust.</p>

<div id="century-materialists" class="section level3">
<h3>20 century materialists</h3>
<p>Mind= Body and there is nothing else.</p>
</div>
<div id="descartes" class="section level3">
<h3>Descartes</h3>
<p>Descartes was the first to unpack and present his own developement of Platonic and Aristotelian notions with a look over his shoulder at religion at the same time.</p>
<p>His Meditations are not long.</p>
<p>His famous conclusions ( argued over today):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>je pense donc je suis: i think therefore must exist.</p></li>
<li><p>My mind and my body must be two separate entities</p></li>
<li><p>Although God must be playing a part somewhere because my ideas are “ clear and distinct”</p></li>
<li><p>Ideas consist of a core element and secondary qualities. Eg wax which melts.</p></li>
<li><p>Evil Genius. How do I differentiate between the ideas I have in my dreams and when I’m awake.</p></li>
</ul>
