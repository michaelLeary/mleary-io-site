      <description>Sought to:
import a data set with time series data in columns; transpose the data to a tidy set in which data was switched to rows and retain numeric data type. Create a factor variable on imported data to permit grouping data. From grouped data generate a cumulative frequency column and a relative frequency column using two methods.
 Provide alternate presentation of frequency data with chart.  The data set used in this case was output in million metric tons of steel by the world’s top 50 steel producers as published by the World Steel Association.</description>

      <description>Task was to extract data from an html table and arrange it in a way to provide small conclusions from data.
In this example sought to gain a sense of where India’s ports stand relative to world ports in terms of container thoughput. The ranking shows that India’s ports have some way to go to catch up with the throughput by many of China’s ports.

      <guid>/post/2020/06/18/top-50-port-throughput-by-country/</guid>
      <description>Table of container throughout for top 50 ports sorted and ordered.
The table provides additional history of container port throughput by country.
 Data is drawn from http://www.worldshipping.org/ by way of a google search into excel. Several modifications to data were made in excel. And then flat file in csv form was imported into R. Within R the data was sorted and tabulated.
  The value added to the data from the website was in ranking the data by 2018 column, splitting out port from country, filtering out records for China and India from the broader set of 50 top container ports.</description>

      <description>The trigger to the note is the recent rise in copper, iron ore, and, several agricultural commodities including rice and sugar. Iron ore and copper are typically associated with a rise in industrial activity. By examining the recent rise in context of past movements we hoped to gain a deeper appreciation of where things stand with these two commodities. A further hope was to setup a method to extract such price data for these price series efficiently in future.</description>

The intention is to shrink down the number of categories from 48 to 5 to simplify understanding of statistics to be performed on muscle groups in future.
To achieve that the source variable in the data frame was converted to factor type. It was then duplicated.</description>

      <description>Mix Suzuki generated operating profit of US$2 billion from sales of US$32 billion in FY19 for a year on year decline of 34%. Management attributes the fall in revenue in FY19 to the slow down in India’s economy, the relative strength of the JPY to other currencies, and, the Coronavirus lock downs.
The composition of Suzuki’s revenue and operating profit show clearly that car manufacturing is the core business for the group.</description>

      <description>Conclusion  initial examination of one balance sheet item for dry goods shipping sector shows that most companies carry a reasonably high debt load. GNK emerges as one of the stronger company balance sheets. SHIP among the weakest. Further analysis on assets and cash flow will follow.   Trigger to enquiry The decline in the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) to below 400 caught attention this morning. That level approaches a 25 year low and compares to 1000 in january 2020 and 2500 in september 2019 (representing an 84% decline).</description>

      <description>Conclusions  Estimated farmer pretax in India of around US$84 per 20 foot container of shipped rough raw rice.
 That represents a 78% reduction in take home pretax profit since start of 2020 when estimated pretax stood at US$340/container.
 Despite some increase in price since the start of 2020 farming profitability has fallen sharply.
  Trigger to enquiry Article in Economic Times of India (accessed: 2020-05-12) that reported today that Basmati rice exporters are suffering from higher shipping costs as a result of lack of containers.</description>
