      <description>The note was triggered by a desire to know more about data collected and stored by Garmin devices during activity. After completion of activity a tcx file was imported into R. Various data were identified and placed into a data frame. And then certain information - in this case - heart rate data over time were plotted.

      <description>In this report have used CRAN’s trackeR package to further explore fitness data generated by garmin devices. The trackeR package provides a simple means to extract and manipulate the tcx file that can be downloaded from Garmin’s connect site. We have replicated some of the examples provided by the package authors with personal data to see how it works.
A 2017 research article in the Journal of Statistical Software provides greater insight into the package’s functionality.</description>
