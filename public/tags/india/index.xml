      <description>Task: Extract table data of India districts from Wikipedia Combine each table rows into one dataframe; add a column to combined data frame that provides name of original dataframe - so as to facilitate identifying source of data reorder the columns in expanded data frame to put original data frame column first.  There are 36 tables of India states and territories listed on the wikipedia page. Each table was extracted and stored in a separate data frame.</description>

      <description>Task was to extract data from an html table and arrange it in a way to provide small conclusions from data.
In this example sought to gain a sense of where India’s ports stand relative to world ports in terms of container thoughput. The ranking shows that India’s ports have some way to go to catch up with the throughput by many of China’s ports.
 After finding sample data from https://www.</description>

      <title>Top 50 port throughput by country</title>

      <description>Table of container throughout for top 50 ports sorted and ordered.
The table provides additional history of container port throughput by country.
 Data is drawn from http://www.worldshipping.org/ by way of a google search into excel. Several modifications to data were made in excel. And then flat file in csv form was imported into R. Within R the data was sorted and tabulated.
  The value added to the data from the website was in ranking the data by 2018 column, splitting out port from country, filtering out records for China and India from the broader set of 50 top container ports.</description>

      <description>Background This report focuses on India’s share in the world’s grains industry. It is based on data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) with specific focus on India1.
The May 2020 global market analysis report suggests that - so far - ``the COVID-19 impact on overall global consumption of wheat for food use has been minimal to date&#34;2. It goes further to project that wheat production and consumption, along with corn and rice, will break record levels in excess of 768 million tons and 748 million tons in 2020/20213.</description>

      <description>Objective India is one of the world’s largest producers of wheat. There are two harvests in a year - the rabi harvest between May and June - and the kharif harvest in October and November. Several important festivals take place around the october harvest period.
Given the significance of the farming sector to India in terms of consumption as well as employment have sought to examine quantities of wheat deliveries to market at harvest.</description>

      <description>Conclusions  Estimated farmer pretax in India of around US$84 per 20 foot container of shipped rough raw rice.
 That represents a 78% reduction in take home pretax profit since start of 2020 when estimated pretax stood at US$340/container.
 Despite some increase in price since the start of 2020 farming profitability has fallen sharply.
  Trigger to enquiry Article in Economic Times of India (accessed: 2020-05-12) that reported today that Basmati rice exporters are suffering from higher shipping costs as a result of lack of containers.</description>
