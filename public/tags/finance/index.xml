      <description>Mix Suzuki generated operating profit of US$2 billion from sales of US$32 billion in FY19 for a year on year decline of 34%. Management attributes the fall in revenue in FY19 to the slow down in India’s economy, the relative strength of the JPY to other currencies, and, the Coronavirus lock downs.
The composition of Suzuki’s revenue and operating profit show clearly that car manufacturing is the core business for the group.</description>

      <description>Conclusion  initial examination of one balance sheet item for dry goods shipping sector shows that most companies carry a reasonably high debt load. GNK emerges as one of the stronger company balance sheets. SHIP among the weakest. Further analysis on assets and cash flow will follow.   Trigger to enquiry The decline in the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) to below 400 caught attention this morning. That level approaches a 25 year low and compares to 1000 in january 2020 and 2500 in september 2019 (representing an 84% decline).</description>
