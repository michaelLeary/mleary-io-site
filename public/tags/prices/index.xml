      <description>The trigger to the note is the recent rise in copper, iron ore, and, several agricultural commodities including rice and sugar. Iron ore and copper are typically associated with a rise in industrial activity. By examining the recent rise in context of past movements we hoped to gain a deeper appreciation of where things stand with these two commodities. A further hope was to setup a method to extract such price data for these price series efficiently in future.</description>
