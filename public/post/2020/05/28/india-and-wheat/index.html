<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This report focuses on India’s share in the world’s grains industry. It is based on data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture’s <em>Foreign Agricultural Service</em> (FAS) with specific focus on India<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The May 2020 global market analysis report suggests that - so far - ``the COVID-19 impact on overall global consumption of wheat for food use has been minimal to date"<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. It goes further to project that wheat production and consumption, along with corn and rice, will break record levels in excess of 768 million tons and 748 million tons in 2020/2021<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Major wheat producers identified include: EU, China, India, Russia, US, Canada, Ukraine, Pakistan, and, Australia with greatest consumers of wheat from China, EU, India, Russia, US, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, and, Brazil. Some sense of these respective contributions are shown in the chart.</p>
<p>The chart illustrates the relative standings by country. And shows the sizable difference in production and consumption between the EU, China and India in one group and other nations. Broadly speaking these three produce and consume around half the annual crop.</p>
<p>Five elements make up wheat consumption and are: food, seed, industrial, feed, and, residual use. Of these food, seed and industrial (FSI) make up 75% of wheat use or some 561 million tons. The driver for the rise in FSI consumption is stated as population growth and changing diets within Asia.</p>
<div id="production-expectation" class="section level2">
<h2>Production expectation</h2>
<p>The report projected global wheat production of 768 million for 2020/2021 up 0.5%. 75% of the increase is projected to be delivered by the top 8 exporting countries including: Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Canada and Argentina. Gains from these countries more than offset a decline in production anticipated for EU, US and Ukraine. Among other producers China is forecast to register a modest increase at 135 million tons and India’s forecast is for 103 million tonnes.</p>
</div>
<div id="consumption-expectation" class="section level2">
<h2>Consumption expectation</h2>
<p>Consumption is forecast to reach a record with growth expected across all regions and especially in South and East Asia on rising food use in India and China. The segment is largely driven by food, seed and industrial use. Consumers in many emerging markets are expected to shift towards more wheat based diets with rising income and urbanization. The other element of consumption which is for feed and residual use exhibits more variability in consumption pattern that depends on price relationship to other grains.</p>
</div>
<div id="stocks" class="section level2">
<h2>Stocks</h2>
<p>For the period ending May 2021 the FAS projects ending wheat stocks at 310 million tons with 160 million tons held by China and 27 million tons by India.</p>

<p>Exporter held stocks are the supplies that are readily available to the global market and can affect prices. So these levels are often considered a relevant metric for analysis.</p>
<p>That being said wheat prices are not solely affected by change in wheat stock levels but also by the change in corn prices.</p>
<p>The report points to the abundance of world corn supplies in 2020/2021 that are expected to outweigh relatively tight export held global wheat supplies. And so the prospect for US season average farm price is unchanged at $4.60/bushel.</p>
