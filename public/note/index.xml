      <description>Conclusions  Estimated farmer pretax in India of around US$84 per 20 foot container of shipped rough raw rice.
 That represents a 78% reduction in take home pretax profit since start of 2020 when estimated pretax stood at US$340/container.
 Despite some increase in price since the start of 2020 farming profitability has fallen sharply.
  Trigger to enquiry Article in Economic Times of India (accessed: 2020-05-12) that reported today that Basmati rice exporters are suffering from higher shipping costs as a result of lack of containers.</description>
